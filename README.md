# Introduction & Overview
The purpose of this application is to display a list of tasks set by the user with a deadline. Each task is input by the user, with a deadline of their choice. 

To add a task to your to-do list, find the input field located to the _left_ of the **green** `+` button. 

From there, the user will be asked for a deadline (`date` and `time`), which will be displayed on the list item when created. 

The final list item will display 5 individual attributes. 
`1.` Task Name
`2.` Deadline Date
`3.` Countdown Until Deadline
`4.` Complete Task Button
`5.` Delete Task Button

For now, these will be the only attributes of each task. In the future, more features like leaving notes will be implemented.

The **red** button will delete all items on the todo list. The user will be confronted with a confirmation upon clicking the button, to ensure the user does not accidentally lose all items on their todo list from a miss-click.
