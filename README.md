# Introduction & Overview
The purpose of this application is to display a list of tasks set by the user with a deadline. Each task is input by the user, with a deadline of their choice. 

To add a task to your todo list, find the input field located to the _left_ of the **green** `+` button. 

From there, the user will be asked for a deadline (`date` and `time`), which will be displayed on the list item when created. 

The final list item will display **5** individual attributes. 

1. Task Name
2. Deadline (Date)
3. Deadline (Time of day)
4. Complete Task Button
5. Delete Task Button

For _now_, these will be the only attributes of each task. In the future, more features like leaving notes will be implemented.

The **red** button will delete all items on the todo list. The user will be confronted with a confirmation upon clicking the button, to ensure the user does not accidentally lose all items on their todo list from a miss-click. The `No` option, will return to the home screen. The `Yes` option will delete all list items.

The application will remain functional and operational on all device screens. For the best experiences, desktop/laptop will have the best results. More optimal changes will be made in the future, for specific devices. However, for now each device has its own responsive layout.

## What I've learned from this project
This is my "biggest" project so far, in terms of javascript. I've managed to both expand upon and learn new things. It's also been a great experience getting even more familiar with CSS, as there are so many different ways to do things, and it just comes down to personal preference. The same can be said about Javascript, but there are generally "best practices" that you conclude to using upon research and trial and error. What i've specifically been able to learn is the following:
